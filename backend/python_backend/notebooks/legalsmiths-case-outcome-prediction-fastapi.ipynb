While the State of Maharashtra has a strong legal basis to regulate emerging technologies like AI for public safety and data privacy under the 'reasonable restriction' clause of Article 19(6), the company's strongest avenue of challenge lies in proving that the *manner* of regulation, specifically the licensing process, is arbitrary, opaque, and disproportionate, thereby violating fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 19(1)(g). It is crucial to collect concrete evidence of procedural infirmities and potential for misuse. A complete striking down of the entire Act is unlikely. The more realistic and advisable strategy is to seek judicial directives for the modification of the Act's provisions to ensure transparency, objectivity, and due process in the licensing framework. The focus should be on ensuring that the regulations are truly 'reasonable' and 'proportionate' to the stated public interest objectives, rather than being instruments that stifle legitimate trade and innovation. Non-compliance, if the challenge fails, could lead to significant financial penalties, operational shutdowns, and severe reputational damage.\"\n}\n```\nGenerated answers.\nRequest was processed in 26.12 seconds.\nINFO:     103.132.31.50:0 - \"POST /caseoutcomeprediction HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK\nINFO:     103.132.31.50:0 - \"OPTIONS /caseoutcomeprediction HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK\nNew Request Received\nRaw Gemini response: ```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Legal Advisory to ABC Technologies Pvt.
