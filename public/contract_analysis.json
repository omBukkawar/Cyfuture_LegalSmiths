      "payment_terms": "Service Provider's prices/rates are firm for the contract period, subject only to adjustments for government-mandated minimum wage revisions. These rates are deemed to cover all costs, expenses, liabilities, and risks. The Institute will pay charges up to the effective termination date if the contract is terminated. No payment will be made to the service provider during force majeure events or when the mess is closed. The service provider must pay minimum wages to workers. Any costs incurred by the Institute due to the service provider's liabilities will be recovered from dues. The maximum cost of raw material is Rs. 50/- per student per day, subject to revision by the Institute. Fines for residents eating under rebate without a coupon are Rs. 500. The service provider must submit monthly bills for service charges and bi-weekly bills for raw material procurement. The service provider can deduct up to 1/5th of the raw material cost per student per day from workmen's wages for meals, which must be deposited to the hostel monthly. The cost of arbitration is mentioned but the party bearing it is not explicitly stated in the provided text.",
      "obligations": "The **Service Provider** must: execute work as per the Scope of Work, ensure quality, procure wholesome food, comply with all labor laws (e.g., Minimum Wages Act, ESI, EPF, Contract Labour Act), maintain records, ensure staff conduct and safety, provide meals to workmen, manage stocks, facilitate raw material procurement, account for coupon sales, not sublet the contract, obtain workman's compensation insurance, and commence work within 10 days. The **Institute** must: provide clarifications, appoint an arbitrator for disputes, and make efforts to pay bills promptly. The **Warden in-charge/Warden** (representing the Institute) has significant authority to: impose penalties, make final decisions on discrepancies, determine necessary work, and direct the service provider.",
      "termination": "The contract is for a 1-year period, extendable by mutual consent. The Institute can terminate the contract at any time for any reason, including unsatisfactory performance or violation of terms, with a 30-day written notice (which can be reduced in exceptional circumstances) without assigning reasons. If the service provider fails to perform, violates statutory provisions, suspends work, or commits other breaches, the Institute can rescind the contract, take possession of premises and materials, and carry on the work. If a force majeure event lasts over one month, the Institute has the option to cancel the contract. Upon termination, the Institute will pay charges up to the effective date, but the service provider remains liable for prior obligations.",
      "mistakes_ambiguities": "1. The clause 'cost of arbitration shall be borne by the' (7.14.4) is incomplete, not specifying which party bears the cost. 2. The clause 'The charges for providing operational services in the mess of Hall-__ shall be' (5.1) is incomplete, not stating the actual charges or how they are determined. 3. Numerous blank lines and placeholders (e.g., 'Hall of Residence No.-__', '______________________') indicate missing specific details. 4. The 'Scope of Work' is 'broadly but not extensively described,' with 'finer details' to be finalized by the Warden, creating potential for scope creep. 5. The contract contains fragmented sections and numbered lists without clear context or complete sentences, making interpretation difficult.",
      "red_flags": "1. **One-Sided Authority:** The Warden in-charge/Warden's decisions are 'final and conclusive' on discrepancies and 'final and binding' on necessary work, even if not explicitly in the contract, giving the Institute excessive control. 2. **Broad Risk Transfer:** The service provider is 'deemed to have known' all aspects of the work and bears 'all costs, expenses and liabilities of every description and all risks of every kind,' including those not explicitly stated or due to errors in contract documents. 3. **Unilateral Termination:** The Institute can terminate the contract 'for any reason' with 30 days' notice 'without assigning any reasons thereof,' which is highly unfavorable to the service provider. 4. **Force Majeure Risk:** The service provider bears all financial loss during force majeure events, as 'no amount shall be payable to the service provider' by the Institute. 5. **Biased Arbitration:** A Sole Arbitrator is appointed by the Deputy Director of the Institute, which lacks independence. Challenging the arbitrator's jurisdiction after the award is also prohibited. 6. **Fixed Prices:** Prices are firm for one year with only minimum wage adjustments, exposing the service provider to risks from other cost escalations (e.g., raw materials).",
      "plain_summary": "This contract for messing services between an Institute and a service provider is for a one-year term, with the service provider responsible for all aspects of food service, staffing, and legal compliance. The Institute, through its Warden, has extensive authority over operations, quality, and dispute resolution. The agreement places significant financial and operational risks on the service provider, including fixed pricing, full liability for unforeseen costs, and bearing all costs during force majeure. The Institute also retains broad rights to terminate the contract without cause, making it a highly one-sided agreement.",
      "risk_level": "High",
      "risk_level_reason": "The contract is heavily skewed in favor of the Institute, transferring substantial risks and liabilities to the service provider through one-sided clauses regarding decision-making, cost responsibility, force majeure, and termination rights.",
      "recommendations": "1. **Negotiate Key Clauses:** Seek to amend clauses related to the Institute's unilateral termination rights, the allocation of financial risk during force majeure, and the 'final and binding' nature of the Warden's decisions. 2. **Ensure Independent Arbitration:** Advocate for an arbitration process with an independently appointed arbitrator to ensure fairness. 3. **Clarify Scope and Costs:** Request a more detailed Scope of Work and clarify how 'finer details' will be compensated. Discuss mechanisms for price adjustments beyond minimum wages for other cost escalations. 4. **Complete Missing Information:** Fill in all blanks and incomplete sentences, especially regarding arbitration costs and service charges. 5. **Seek Legal Review:** Have a lawyer thoroughly review the contract to identify all potential legal risks and ensure compliance with applicable laws, particularly regarding labor and contract fairness."
